üç≥ Recipefy-Chefbot AI
Welcome to Recipefy-Chefbot, an intelligent culinary assistant designed to inspire your next meal! This full-stack application leverages the power of AI to generate unique recipes from the ingredients you have on hand and answers your cooking questions with a conversational AI chef.

üöÄ Live Demo
You can try the live application right now!

Frontend (React App): https://chimerical-wisp-0e018b.netlify.app/

Backend (Spring Boot API): https://recipefy-chefbot.onrender.com/

(Note: The backend is hosted on a free service, so the first request might take a moment to "wake up" the server.)

‚ú® Features
This application is split into two main AI-powered modules:

1. Recipe Generator
Ingredient-Based Creation: Simply enter a list of comma-separated ingredients.

Dietary Customization: Specify dietary restrictions (e.g., "vegetarian", "gluten-free") to tailor the recipe.

Cuisine Specification: Guide the AI by requesting a specific cuisine (e.g., "Italian", "Mexican").

2. ChefBot Assistant
Conversational AI: Ask any cooking-related question.

Expert Knowledge: Get tips on cooking techniques, ingredient substitutions, or food pairings.

Creative Inspiration: Ask for meal ideas for a specific occasion.
